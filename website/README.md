# Lovely Home marketing site

Static marketing pages for [lovely-home.co.uk](https://lovely-home.co.uk), deployed separately from the hub PWA (`dashboard.lovely-home.co.uk`).

## Pages

| Path | Purpose |

| `/` | Product landing (no link to private dashboard) |
| `/app.html` | Screenshot gallery |
| `/support.html` | Support & FAQ |
| `/privacy.html` | Privacy policy |

## Local preview

```bash
npx serve website
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Deploy

Requires Cloudflare Pages project **`lovely-home`** and `wrangler` auth:

```bash

```

Attach the custom domain **lovely-home.co.uk** (and optionally **www**) in the Cloudflare dashboard after the first deploy. Point DNS at Cloudflare when the domain transfer from Hostinger is complete.
